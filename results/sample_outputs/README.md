## 🔍 Interpretation Guidelines

### Flood Detection Interpretation
1. **Blue Areas (VV < -2 dB)**: Confirmed flood zones
2. **Light Blue Areas (VV -1 to -2 dB)**: Potential flood zones
3. **White Areas (VV -1 to +1 dB)**: No significant change
4. **Red Areas (VV > +1 dB)**: New rough features

### Vegetation Impact Interpretation
1. **Red Areas (VH < -1 dB)**: Vegetation loss/damage
2. **Orange Areas (VH -0.5 to -1 dB)**: Light vegetation impact
3. **White Areas (VH -0.5 to +0.5 dB)**: Stable vegetation
4. **Green Areas (VH > +0.5 dB)**: Vegetation growth

### Surface Roughness Interpretation
1. **Purple Areas (Ratio < -0.3)**: Smoother surfaces (water)
2. **Blue Areas (Ratio -0.3 to -0.1)**: Moderately smooth
3. **White Areas (Ratio -0.1 to +0.1)**: Stable roughness
4. **Yellow Areas (Ratio > +0.1)**: Rougher surfaces
